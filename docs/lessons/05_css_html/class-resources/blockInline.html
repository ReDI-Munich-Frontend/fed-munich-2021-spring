        Today we discovered that boxes all around us,
        and there are different types! We have <span>Inline boxes such as myself</span>
        they don't take much space just what they need! 
    </div>
    <div>
        On the other side there are block boxes, they are not as polite as the inline ones.
        <p>We break in a new line and take all the space the can!</p>
    </div>
