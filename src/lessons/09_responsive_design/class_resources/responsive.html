            <h1>Tyrannosaurus!</h1>
            <p>
              Tyrannosaurus[nb 1] is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod
              dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in
              Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the
              best represented of the large theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived
              throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an
              island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much
              wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a
              variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the
              Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the
              last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last
              non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene
              extinction event.
            </p>

            <p>
              Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore
              with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to
              its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus
              were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two
              clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3
              meters (40 feet) in length, though T. rex could grow to lengths of
              over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.96 m (13 ft) tall at the hips, and
              according to most modern estimates 8.4 metric tons (9.3 short
              tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in weight. Although
              other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it
              is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated
              to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial
              animals.
            </p>

            <p>
              By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex
              was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs,
              juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and
              possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was
              primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was
              an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates
              in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that
              Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.
            </p>

            <p>
              Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include some that are nearly
              complete skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in
              at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material
              has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology,
              including its life history and biomechanics.
