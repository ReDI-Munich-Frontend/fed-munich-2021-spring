# Introduction to CSS
In this lesson we will be learning about how CSS works, how does the browser interprets it and how does it decide which rules should be applied.

I recommend playing the game in the link below (Selectors Game) to practice more with selectors!

The files used in the demos during the lesson can be found inside the folder class-resources.
