    <h1>MissingNo.</h1>
    <p id="main" class="info important">
      MissingNo. (Japanese: けつばん, Hepburn: Ketsuban), short for <strong class="important">"Missing
        Number" </strong>and sometimes spelled without the period, is an unofficial Pokémon
      species found in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue. Due to the
      programming of certain in-game events, players can encounter MissingNo.
      via a glitch. Encountering MissingNo. causes graphical anomalies and
      changes gameplay by increasing the number of items in the sixth entry of
      the player's inventory by 128. This beneficial effect resulted in the
      glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines, while game
      publisher Nintendo warned that encountering the glitch may corrupt
      players' game data. IGN noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and
      Blue was one of the most famous video game glitches and commented on its
      role in increasing the series' popularity. Fans have attempted to
      rationalize and incorporate MissingNo. as part of the games' canon as an
      actual in-game character, and sociologists have studied its impact on both
      players and gaming culture as a whole.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p class="info">
      A player can encounter a MissingNo. in Pokémon Red and Blue by following a
      series of steps. First, the player watches an in-game tutorial for Pokémon
      capture in Viridian City. Second, the player uses a Pokémon with the "Fly"
      move to instantly travel to the game's Cinnabar Island location. Finally,
      the player uses a Pokémon with the "Surf" move to travel up and down the
      eastern shore of the island until a MissingNo. appears.[8] These events
      manipulate the game's random encounter system to generate a Pokémon with
      an invalid identifier. Each area within the game assigns values to a data
      buffer to represent the Pokémon that can be encountered in that area.
      However, some areas—such as Cinnabar Island—do not overwrite the data in
      this buffer, so the data from the previous area is used instead. During an
      in-game tutorial in which the player character's name is overridden to
      read "Old Man", the player character's actual name is temporarily copied
      to that same data buffer.

    <p class="info">
        If the player travels directly to Cinnabar
        Island after viewing this tutorial, the player's name will be read as the
        Pokémon that can be randomly encountered in that area. Due to the player
        character's name not being intended to be read as this kind of data, the
        game can attempt to generate an encounter with a Pokémon with an invalid
        identifier, such as MissingNo.[9][10] Fans have dubbed this method of
        encountering MissingNo. <strong>the "old man glitch"</strong>.[9][11] As with any wild
        Pokémon, players may flee from, fight, or capture MissingNo.[10] After an
        encounter with MissingNo., the quantity of the sixth item in the player's
        inventory is increased by 128,[12] and the game's Hall of Fame Pokémon
        gallery becomes glitched.[11] Temporary graphical glitches may also
        occur,[11] which can be removed by viewing the statistics page for another
        non-glitched Pokémon or resetting the console.[13] A captured MissingNo.
        is functional as a Pokémon and appears in the games' Pokédex as number
        000.[9][10] The games classify it as a hybrid Bird/Normal-type Pokémon
        even though the category of Bird-type Pokémon was cut from the games
        before release.[9][14] It commonly appears with a scrambled block-like
        form commonly described as a "backward L-shape", but depending on the
        player character's name, it can also appear as one of three ghost or
        fossil sprites not used by other Pokémon.[13][15]
